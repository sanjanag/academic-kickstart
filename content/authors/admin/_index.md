I am a Masters student in Computer Science in Georgia Institute of Technology. I am working with Prof. Munmun De Choudhury, as part of SocWeb Lab where my research is focussed on analyzing drug abuse discourse on social media. My interests lie in natural language processing and social computing. 

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was working as a Software Developer at Rivigo for 2 years. I worked on several challenging projects here like building Rivigo Maps, search engine and notfication service.
