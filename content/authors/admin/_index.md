I am a Masters' student in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/), as part of [SocWeb Lab](http://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/) where my research is focussed on analyzing drug abuse discourse on social media. My interests lie in natural language processing and social computing. 

I also worked as a Software Developer at [Rivigo](https://www.rivigo.com/) for 2 years. I worked on several challenging projects here including Rivigo Maps, search engine and notification service.
